          <h1>What is <span style="font-style: italic">Veganism?</span></h1>
          <p>
            Considered a "strict vegetarian", a <span style="font-style: italic">vegan</span> refrains from consuming
            animal products of any kind, including dairy, butter, eggs, and fish. Some vegans go so far as to avoid the use of animals as a part of body coverage, such as purses, belts and shoes as well.
            <br>
            <br>
            Many diets in the diet culture embrace the idea of veganism to a ceratine degree, including paleo, which focuses on all natural and whole foods (exlcuding the animal-product portion, obviously), and even the ketogenic community has had
            folks follow a vegan regimine, and even still stay in Ketosis!
            <br>
            <br>
            No matter what kind of diet you may follow, it's important to know what you are putting in your body, weather it be through skin products, food, or drinks! Remember- YOU ARE WHAT YOU EAT!
            <br>
            <br>
            There are several ways to get up to speed quickly with a <span style="font-style: italic">vegan</span> lifestyle, but it's best to take things slowly and allow time for your body and mind to adapt. The best thing you can do to incorporate
            a <span style="font-style: italic">vegan</span> mindset, is to work on replacing more meals throughout your day with more vegetables and fruits, with the idea that eventually, those nutrious options will become your primary souce of fuel.
